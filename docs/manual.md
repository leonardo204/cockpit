---

## 5. Browser Automation (CLI)

Control browser bubbles opened in Console via the `cockpit browser` command.
(`cock` works the same way — it's the prod-only short alias of `cockpit`.
For the dev server use `cockpit-dev` instead.)

### 5.1 Basic Usage

```bash
cockpit browser list                        # List all connected browsers
cockpit browser <id>                        # View status and help
cockpit browser <id> --help                 # Full command list
```

`<id>` is the 4-character short identifier shown in the bubble's title bar.

### 5.2 Navigation

```bash
cockpit browser <id> navigate --url <url>   # Navigate to URL
cockpit browser <id> reload                 # Reload page
cockpit browser <id> reload --noCache       # Reload ignoring cache
cockpit browser <id> back                   # Go back
cockpit browser <id> forward                # Go forward
cockpit browser <id> url                    # Get current URL
cockpit browser <id> title                  # Get page title
```

### 5.3 Page Inspection

```bash
cockpit browser <id> snapshot               # Get page element tree (a11y tree, each element has a ref ID)
cockpit browser <id> screenshot             # Take screenshot, save to /tmp, returns path
```

### 5.4 Interaction

```bash
cockpit browser <id> click --ref e5         # Click element
cockpit browser <id> type --ref e3 --text "hello"   # Type text
cockpit browser <id> fill --ref e3 --value "hello"  # Fill form field
cockpit browser <id> hover --ref e5         # Hover
cockpit browser <id> focus --ref e5         # Focus
cockpit browser <id> scroll --direction down        # Scroll
cockpit browser <id> key Enter              # Press key
cockpit browser <id> wait --text "Dashboard"        # Wait for text to appear
```

Ref IDs are obtained via the `snapshot` command.

### 5.5 JavaScript Execution

```bash
cockpit browser <id> evaluate --js "return document.title"
cockpit browser <id> evaluate --js "return document.querySelector('.btn').textContent" --all-frames
```

`--all-frames` executes across all iframes. The execution context inherits the page's authentication state.

### 5.6 Debugging Tools

```bash
cockpit browser <id> console --level error          # View console errors
cockpit browser <id> network --status 4xx,5xx       # View failed network requests
cockpit browser <id> network_record start           # Start recording network requests
cockpit browser <id> network_record stop            # Stop recording and output results
cockpit browser <id> perf --metric timing           # Page load performance
cockpit browser <id> cookies                        # View cookies
cockpit browser <id> storage --type local           # View localStorage
cockpit browser <id> theme --mode dark              # Toggle dark mode
```

### 5.7 Assertions

```bash
cockpit browser <id> assert --ref e5 --visible true
# Outputs PASS or FAIL; exit code is 1 on failure
```

### 5.8 Data Flow

```
CLI command → HTTP API → WebSocket → BrowserBubble → postMessage → iframe content script → execute → result returns via same path
```

## 6. Terminal Automation (CLI)

Control terminal bubbles in Console via the `cockpit terminal` command.
(`cock` works the same way — it's the prod-only short alias of `cockpit`.
For the dev server use `cockpit-dev` instead.)

```bash
cockpit terminal list                       # List all terminals
cockpit terminal <id>                       # View status and help
cockpit terminal <id> output                # Read terminal buffer output
cockpit terminal <id> output --grep 'ERROR' # Filter output by pattern (server-side)
cockpit terminal <id> wait idle             # Block until the terminal goes quiet
```

---

## 6.5 Connection Enumeration (CLI)

Cross-type bubble listing in one call — terminals + browsers together, each
with its user-set **title** (set via the ✎ button next to the short id badge).
Designed for the `/cc` slash mode in chat: an LLM asks "which bubble is the
alloydb proxy?", runs `cockpit connection list`, and matches by title.

```bash
cockpit connection list                     # Every alive bubble (across all projects)
cockpit connection list --cwd .             # Only bubbles in the current project
cockpit connection list --cwd . --all       # Include disconnected / exited bubbles
cockpit connection list --cwd . --json      # Machine-readable for scripting
```

Output (TAB-separated, one line per bubble):

```
<type>  <shortId>  <title-or-(none)>  <projectCwd>  <command-or-url>
```

Exit codes: `0`=hits, `1`=no bubbles, `2`=usage, `3`=server unreachable.

Use this **before** picking a `<id>` for `cockpit terminal <id> ...` /
`cockpit browser <id> ...` when the user describes a bubble by purpose
("the staging admin browser") rather than by short id.
