/**
 * /api/commands — list builtin slash commands.
 *
 * Used to also enumerate `.md` files under `.claude/commands/` and
 * `~/.claude/commands/` (project + global), mirroring Claude Code's command
 * convention. That convention has been retired, so this endpoint now returns
 * the in-process builtin set only.
 *
 * Each entry MUST have a matching expansion in COMMAND_CONTENT
 * (packages/feature/agent/src/server/lib/slashCommands.ts). Listing a name
 * here without an expansion makes the dropdown advertise a feature that
 * silently no-ops on dispatch.
