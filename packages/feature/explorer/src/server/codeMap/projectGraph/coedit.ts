/**
 * Co-edit projection — files that are frequently changed alongside a target
 * file, derived from git history + working-tree state.
 *
 * Why this exists: the call-graph projections (callers/callees/impact) can
 * only express STATIC relationships — "X calls Y", "Y imports X". They can't
 * see CONVENTIONAL coupling: two parallel registries that have to stay in
 * sync but never mention each other in source. The canonical example in
 * cockpit is COMMAND_CONTENT (in slashCommands.ts) and BUILTIN_COMMANDS (in
 * commands.ts) — both list /qa /fx /cg, but neither file imports the other.
 *
 * Humans encode these conventions in git history: when /cg was added, both
 * files were edited in the same commit. So files that co-appear in commits
 * with the target are a strong signal of conventional coupling, regardless
 * of whether the language semantics see any connection.
 *
 * Two sources, both essential:
 *   1. `git log` history — past co-edits (the "we've been doing this together")
 *   2. `git status` working tree — current uncommitted co-edits (the "we're
 *      doing this together RIGHT NOW", which history can't see yet)
 *
 * Source 2 matters because AI is often called mid-edit, before commit. If we
 * only looked at history, a brand-new dual edit would be invisible until
 * after commit. The working-tree pass closes that gap.
 *
 * Stateless: no caching, every request shells out fresh. Calls are cheap
 * (~15 ms on typical repos because git uses packfile indexes) so a per-
 * request cache would be premature optimisation.
