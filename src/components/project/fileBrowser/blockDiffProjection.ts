/**
 * blockDiffProjection — pure helpers for turning a (oldContent,
 * newContent, filePath) triple into the data the chip-view diff
 * (`BlockDiffViewer`) needs.
 *
 * Lives in its own module so the viewer file stays UI-only:
 *   - The viewer just calls `buildImpactProjection` and feeds the
 *     result into `BlockViewer` via three optional props
 *     (qnameFilter / accentQnames / addedLines).
 *   - This module owns the parser / line-diff / qname-classification
 *     plumbing.
 *
 * Block-pairing strategy — TWO paths feed `changedQnames`:
 *
 *   1. STABLE-QNAME path (qname + contentHash matching). Real symbols
 *      (`function` / `class` / `method` / …) and stable synthetics
 *      (`__imports__`, `__preamble__`) have qnames that survive
 *      between snapshots, so we pair before/after by qname and
 *      classify each pair as added / deleted / modified by content
 *      hash. Deleted blocks are tracked but NOT added to
 *      `changedQnames` — chip view renders after-state, so a deleted
 *      block has no row to render.
 *
 *   2. LINE-OVERLAP path (for line-range synthetics). `__code_<lo>_<hi>__`
 *      and `__heading_<n>__` encode line numbers in their qname, so
 *      they can't be paired across snapshots (every edit shifts
 *      surrounding line ranges → naive qname diff would emit a noisy
 *      "delete + add" stream for every chunk). Instead we extract
 *      AFTER-snapshot synthetics and check whether each block's
 *      `[startLine, endLine]` range overlaps any line in `addedLines`.
 *      AFTER (not before) because BlockViewer renders AFTER content;
 *      a BEFORE qname has no DOM row to filter onto.
 *
 *   3. The empty-file fallback `__file__` is handled by NEITHER path
 *      — it only ever appears in the no-grammar branch, which short-
 *      circuits early and returns `{ addedLines }` with `changedQnames:
 *      undefined`, signalling the caller to skip the qname filter
 *      altogether (otherwise the lone `__file__` chip would be
 *      filtered out).
