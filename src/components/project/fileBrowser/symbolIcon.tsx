/**
 * Shared symbol → Lucide icon resolver, exposed as a tiny `<SymbolIcon>`
 * component.
 *
 * The Code Map renders the same symbol in three places (block header,
 * history drawer, search palette). Centralising the kind → icon mapping
 * here keeps those three views in lockstep without any of them having
 * to know the others exist.
 *
 * Why a component (rather than returning the picked LucideIcon
 * directly): React's `react-hooks/static-components` lint rule flags
 * code that produces a component identifier mid-render. Wrapping the
 * lookup inside a stable, module-scoped component sidesteps the rule
 * entirely — the *consumer* never sees a dynamically-picked component
 * reference, only a stable `<SymbolIcon>`.
 *
 * Visual style intent: roughly mirror VSCode's outline glyphs AND its
 * symbol palette — function/method violet, class amber, interface
 * blue, everything else muted. The colour cue carries weight on its
 * own, so the icon is parseable even at 12-14px without leaning on
 * shape alone (the older monochrome version was too easy to scan past).
 *
 * Colour is built into the component (not the caller). Call sites pass
 * size + layout classes only; we prepend the kind colour. Tailwind's
 * "last duplicate wins" means a caller can still override via a more
 * specific colour utility if they really want to, but the default is
 * "icon owns its kind colour" — single source of truth.
 *
 * Markdown synthesis: server-side, markdown chunks come back with
 * `kind: 'unknown'` and special-cased qnames (`__file__`,
 * `__heading_*__`, `__preamble__`). We sniff those qnames here so the
 * three view sites don't each re-implement the same special-casing.
